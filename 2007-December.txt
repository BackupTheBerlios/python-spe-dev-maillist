Hello Everybody,

I am using spe 0.8.3 on Ubuntu 7.10. You are using wxversion to select
the correct version of Wx. I found spe not working with wx 2.8.4 which
is shipped in Ubuntu. So why not using wxversion to select the
recommended version of Wx instead of the latest version available? I
patched my spe install and it works smooth (killer python ide by the
way). The changes needed for that are

trunk/_spe/SPE.py

Might give that a thought? Otherwise svn might work with 2.8.4 but cant
test her (need this box for work at the moment)

Thanks for reporting, but I am working with MOTU on this:
https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/spe/+bug/124896

Besides that I would recommmend of using spe from subversion as it 
contains bug fixes for ubuntu and linux in general.
