Subject: [spe-dev] SVN 159: Better ubuntu support and first steps towards
	wxPython2.8
Message-ID: <2078a7ad0702232038y7de2ce5dg693eaae30543f22e@mail.gmail.com>

Hi All,

I didn't test this build yet on wxPython2.8, but this for sure fixes
already some issues.

I might also work with Jurjen Bos for better Mac support. Fixes for
WinPdb debugger and wxGlade GUI builder will follow soon. My main
development platform switched from Windows to Ubuntu. (I can recommend
this to anyone.) I will keep one Window machine to continue supporting
& testing SPE on Windows.

Now the debugger should not fail anymore.
