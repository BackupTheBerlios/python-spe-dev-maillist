Message-ID: <42F18823.4070908@gmail.com>

Hi,
Richard E. Brown posted this on the spe-mac mailing list, but maybe some 
of you have a mac as well and are not on this list. Others might 
symphatise as well. Of course it is a nice initiative I fully support. I 
have been postponing to implement some nice new features for SPE to make 
it stable on the Mac. You can follow the status of the fund raising on 
the new SPE homepage: http://www.stani.be/python/spe Besides Richard, 
more two people donated already 50 euro.
Thanks for considering,
Stani

Fellow SPE-on-Mac friends:

I think we can all admit that our current scheme for developing SPE-OSX is
terriby inefficient. This "remote control" debugging is slow, results in a
flurry of updates that fix a few things each, and it must be quite frustrating
for Stani.

I have corresponded with Stani, and a Mac mini with a KVM would work well for
him. It's new, it's got a G4 processor so it'll be current for quite a while,
and it'll fit nicely into his physical space.) A Mac mini (500 EUR) + KVM (120
EUR?) + VAT (19%) together cost about 750 Euros. 

My company, Dartware, has contributed 250 Euros to start the fundraising. We're
willing to give a major boost because it's worth it for us to have a nice
environment for working on Python programs. 

What it would be worth *to you* to have a new release of SPE running on your Mac
the same day as it appears on other platforms? $50? $75? $100?

You can contribute using Stani's donation page and put "SPE-on-Mac" in the
comment field. Stani points out that PayPal takes a significant commission on
the donations: if you're in the EU, it's much better to use the bank transfer
mechanism. The URL is:

	http://www.stani.be/python/spe/blog/sm_donate

Thanks for your consideration, and best regards to you all.

PS If ten more people contribute 50 Euros each, that would give Stani the funds
necessary to buy a good development and testing system. Please help with this.

Hi,
The find dialog box is not working well. Probably it's something not too 
hard to fix. Any volunteer? The code is in _spe/Parent.py I'm currently 
working on other things as you can read on the blog. Please send the 
corrected Parent.py to me and I correct the fixes.
Thanks,

Subject: [spe-dev] SPE site down  (please help)

Dear all,

Some of you contacted to warn me that my site is down. Thanks for your 
concerns. Unfortunately the *.stani.be site drove the machine's load up 
to 27 at the Zettai server. This made my site crash and I had to restart 
it frequently. For Zettai, who sponsors SPE in free hosting, this was 
alarming and they decided to shut down my site. Altough I'm experienced 
with Python, I'm not that familiar with Zope. Anyone who could help me 
monitoring what is wrong or even point me to how I could solve the 
problem, would save my days.

I'm currently trying to convince Zettai to see if there is a way to 
continue the SPE website. I have no reasons to complain about them, the 
opposite: they always provided me with an excellent service, so I can 
recommend them to anyone. Honnestly I think that their analysis that 
something is alarmlingly wrong is very justified.

The SPE website uses CoreBlog and I don't think that can be the problem. 
My personal portfolio site www.stani.be uses a lot of Python scripting, 
but has low visitors. So in a way I would be surprised if it's that. 
When the problem occurred, I installed cache managers, but appearantly 
that didn't solve anything.

Recently I have put a lot of effort to develop SPE, especially 
concerning Mac Os X, new website and integrating the debugger. Of course 
this will postpone the release of SPE. The reason is that first this 
will take me time and energy to see what is wrong and to get it back 
online. The second reason is that the google ads displayed on my page 
give me a very small income. I'm donating much of my freetime into this 
project and as donations are seldom and small, any extra income is 
welcome. It's at the moment the only way to generate some revenue with 
open source, as far as I know. This income is mainly generated when 
there is a new release, so I feel it is only reasonable as a developper 
not too lose that opportunity. A company which would sponsor SPE is till 
now still a utopia, or not?

But if some zope expert could help me with solving this problem, please 
contact me. I hope Zettai will continue hosting SPE, otherwise I'll have 
to look for another provider and than everything really gets delayed. 
Also soon I'll have three art shows simultaneously in France, Belgium 
and Germany, so than I have to be away for a while.

Stani

PS 1: Please post all replies to python-spe-users at berlios.de

PS 2: Just in case, if someone still wants to donate: 
http://spe.pycs.net/stories/8.html For Mac users or sympathisants, there 
is still a fund raising campaign that I can buy a mini mac, to support 
SPE fully on mac. Pay by iban (europe) or Paypal (s_t_a_n_i at 
yahoo.com) and mention 'mini-mac'

PS 3: This was the data of the zettai server. For me it is Chinese, the 
only hint I got was "keep your scripts under control", but I don't know 
where to start.

Dear all,
The website is up again. Appearantly the screenshots went crazy, so I 
replaced it with a more simple page.

Subject: [spe-dev] SPE 0.7.5.b will be released any moment.
Message-ID: <42FFA6B3.4010102@gmail.com>

Hi,

I'm now finishing the download page and after that I will release the 
new version of SPE. I just wanted you to know first. So you'll get the 
release soon, it can be any moment from now, but please patient till it 
appears. I'm always looking for people who can do some easy bugfixing, 
if you have a bit of wxPython experience please contact me.

I feel sorry for mac users that I can't make a nice app installer. It 
has one simple reason: I don't have access to a mac. I really appreciate 
the fund raising that some mac users started. If more people would join 
the boat, I could buy a mini mac and give you as well full support on 
Mac Os X.

Of course donations in general are also welcome, as this allows me to 
spend a bit more time on SPE as normal, which you will only enjoy.

Thanks if you consider this seriously.

Stani

I also would like to see SPE stable. However I believe that testing SPE 
on the Mac, will only increase its stability (rather than seeing it as a 
new feature), as wxMac seems to be more sensitive to mistakes. This 
gives in a way the advantage that errors are more fastly discovered. I 
noticed that with some sizer issues. I think if SPE runs well on Windows 
and Mac, probably it is true for all platforms.

The problems with donations till now, is that people start thinking 
about donating after the features they like are implemented. However 
donations are low. That's why I appreciate the donations for the Mac. 
For the first time users are donating to get something done, before it 
is implemented. This made me think I should start a bounty system, where 
I people could bid on features they would like to see implemented. It's 
not that I want to start earning money with SPE, but on the other hand 
it's also a pitty if things could work better if it is stimulated in 
another way. As you might now, developing a project like this asks a lot 
of time. For example a lot of users ask for a project manager, but would 
they be willing to pay for it? Also if SPE would give in some cash in 
one way or another, I could really spend more time on developping it,as 
it means I have to do less other jobs.

After I will have bought the Mac, I will do some serious bugfixing 
effort to make SPE stable on all platforms or as much as possible. (So 
the sooner I have the money for the Mac, hint, hint, ;-) ...) But of 
course I have the most fun by implementing some new cool features. Also 
I think of organising SPE maybe more like Firefox with downloadable 
extensions (which should also be easy for users to create), rather than 
a full suite which it is now.

These were just some thoughts,
Stani

Hi,

I need some help with OpenSSL. I am strugling a bit with pyOpenSSL. All 
it takes are probably just smart answers on some stupid questions. Anyone?

But, as usual members of the SPE mailing list get first notice about the 
new release:

The next version is ready, it contains:
- better windows installers for python2.3 and 2.4
- a lot of bugfixes (eg call tips and autocompletion)
- local files are now recognized by the debugger and pychecker
- the documentation got a boost thanks to Dimitri Pater 
(http://www.serpia.com), thanks!
- and more...

Half good news for Mac users, the moment that I will buy a Mac is coming 
closer but I still need a bit more than 200 euros. The faster you 
donate, the faster you will get SPE gracefully on Mac.

I try to release it tonight, but dont shoot me if it is tomorrow.

Please consider contributing to SPE. Bugfixing is the best way to know 
its code. I will give you full assistance. Are you native english 
speaking? Please read the manual and take out all the stupid mistakes. 
Do you speak another language. Please translate the manual. For a lot of 
languages people are already translating (even including Chinese!), so 
probably you can just join, to share the cake. Do you have other talents 
(web design, zope, images, photoshop, ...), contact me. Do you have not 
any talent, ok, grab your wallet and donate some money!

All the best,

Stani

PS If you donate for mac, please mention it.
