Subject: [spe-dev] SVN 88: NotebookCtrl implemented
Message-ID: <2078a7ad0511301933i5f9e8b2die440a422e0cb90cc@mail.gmail.com>

Hi,

1
I bugfixed Andrea Gavana NotebookCtrl and tried to implement it in SPE. This
might be unstable. Please test this thouroughly. At the moment only these
document interfaces are allowed.

"multiple with sash & tabs (windows default)"
"multiple with sash & tabs (mac default,linux default,windows)"

Other document interfaces are not garantueed to work.

2
Files belonging to the workspace have white tabs, the other stay grey.

3
Drag&drop of tabs will be implemented in the future to change the order of
the tabs. Right now an event for this is lacking. I hope Andrea will
implement it.

Thanks for testing,
Stani

Hi Stefan,
I have no idea what could be interfering. Hopefully the answer is as simple
as that the wxPython uses an old version of wxMac, but I have no idea about
that.

The bug reported by Kay was because of a stupid typo (color instead of
colour). I also applied patches for encoding and browse folder (Cheng).
Please test,test,test,...

Could you tell me, where in the code is a list of classes beeing generated.

Also as a side question, any pointers as to how i might extract the names of

Nice!

In Child.py on line 781 the def updateExplore(self,uml=0) returns
classes for uml when uml=1 is passed as an argument.

Extracting the attributes maybe shouldn't be difficult. You could look
for "self.* =" Maybe only in __init__ or in all functions.

Go for it!

Running files in SPE is one of the weak points, which should be
improved. Therefore I'll redesign it completely. Just to inform
everyone it makes no sense to work on it. When I'm ready, I'd be glad
if you'll test it. This might take some time.

Hi Stani
 
I guess you need a new wxPython build, this has been implemented quite a
few months ago. So it is either that, or something is eating the event
before the textctrl gets it. 
 
Note that using ctx menu for clipboard commands is not very macish btw,
if you use the standard menu ids for cut/copy/paste they are enabled
automatically and the shortcuts work. The thing the context menu is used
for also on mac are spell checking etc.
 
Best,
 
Stefan

NEW RELEASE
Another pre-announcement to the SPE mailing lists... This release is
for those, who like close buttons on the tabs. This is a beta release,
to test if there are problems with this new tab feature. I tested it
on Mac & Windows and hope this will work well. The code for the tabs
was developped by Andrea Gavana and partly bugfixed by me.

CALL FOR HELP!!
I'm having problems implementing the encoding in the right way for
SPE. If anyone of you could help me to solve this issue once and for
ever, it would be very nice. This bug still prevents a lot of users to
choose for SPE. Don't help me, but help them ;-)
Contact me if you know the solution. For more info look at the bottom.
I have some nasty test files to verify your patches ;-)

DETAILS
:**Improved features**:

- Better tabs with close button and colors (white belongs to workspace)

:**Bug fixes**:

- encoding according to PEP
- browse folder
- win98 support for 'run in terminal'

:**Installation**:

- See http://pythonide.stani.be/manual/html/manual2.html
- There is now an update section for MacOS X!

:**Contributors**:

- Andrea Gavana (enhanced tabs)

:**Todo**:

- Show/hide shell (Mac)

The same appear if I delete .spe directory and try to open the same file.

Message-ID: <2078a7ad0512030940p2ec29e15i8d719861c6498e5f@mail.gmail.com>

Hi,
I have switched to Python2.4 Therefore it is impossible for me to make
windows installers for python23. This is however extremely easy, you
don't have to know even python for this. All you have to do is,
download the source tar.gz archive, unzip it and type this at the
command prompt:
>>> python setup.py bdist_wininst

This will create automatically the windows installer for python23. Now
my question is, does anyone of you want to do this for new releases?
I'll give you release rights so you can post this release on BerliOS
and SourceForge.

You'll make a lot people happy and contribute to SPE's succes.
Moreover you'll have the windows installer for yourself, which you'll
need if you want the shortcuts in the start menu and integration in
explorer.

Thanks in advance,
Stani

I hope that is the reason as well. I'm often using my mac through VNC from
windows, and then the shortcuts Cmd+C don't work. That's why I needed the
popup menu.

Hi Richard,
I forgot to update the SVN, so SPE 0.8.0.c is more up to date then
SVN91. The reason I'm not updating at the moment is that I am doing
some major chances which would produce unstable versions. I prefer to
update if SPE is stable again.
SPE will be able to run files and to launch the debugger at any time
or at unhandled exceptions. This is far superior then the run system
now. It works on Windows, but I am working together with Nir Aides to
fix for the Mac. Hope it will work.
I have to go now, I'll answer your other email later.

Subject: [spe-dev] Configurable keyboard shortcuts (emac style)
Message-ID: <2078a7ad0512041254q1d3b1de4nca7d1037812bbcb3@mail.gmail.com>

Hi Toni,

Nice you take this initiative.

What is important first: let's define our design goals: what do we want?
Once that's clear, we can implement it. I prefer to have it fully
implemented, rather then half. What SPE needs is a:
- dialog to configure keyboard shortcuts (this could be launched by a button
in the preferences tab):
     - maybe look to other IDEs to look for the best proposal
     - should support multi-keystrokes
     - users should be able to save keyboard shortcuts (the most important
ones could be collected and be bundled with SPE)
- during keyboard shortcuts there should be feedback on the statusBar
(field1,not field 0, which is used for icons)

How to get around wxGlade? It is easy, I think. In fact I already
implemented it. Maybe you noticed the _spe/shortcuts folder. There you'll
see there are different files for Mac and Windows. So in this way it is
possible to define already one keystroke shortcuts. But with the recipee...
this could be extended. You define keys by the raw menu label in
dictionaries, eg for mac (Macintosh.py):
"""Mac shortcuts for SPE"""
keys = {
    'Save As'       : 'Ctrl+Shift+S',
    'Redo'          : 'Ctrl+Shift+Z',
    'Find Next'     : 'Ctrl+G', # not very logical, but usual on the Mac
    'Go to line'    : 'Ctrl+J', # "Jump"
}

The code which translates that into the menu is in SPE.py, line 133:
####Shortcuts
class Translate:
    def __init__(self,keys):
        self.keys = keys

    def __call__(self,entry):
        entry           = entry.split('\t')
        if len(entry)==2:
            label, shortcut = entry
        else:
            label           = entry[0]
            shortcut        = ''
        l               = self.strip(label)
        if self.keys.has_key(l):
            shortcut    = self.keys[l]
        if shortcut:
            return '%s\t%s'%(label,shortcut)
        else:
            return label

    def strip(self,x):
        return x.replace('&','').replace('.','')

shortcuts    = config.get("DEFAULT","shortcuts")
if shortcuts == smdi.DEFAULT:
    if smdi.DARWIN:
        _shortcuts  = 'Macintosh'
    else:
        _shortcuts  = 'Windows'
else:
    _shortcuts      = shortcuts
import _spe.shortcuts as sc
execfile(os.path.join(os.path.dirname(sc.__file__),'%s.py'%_shortcuts))
import wxgMenu
wxgMenu._   = Translate(keys)

So the trick is to overwrite the 'def _(x)' function which is normally used
for internationalization (another future feature for SPE). wxGlade supports
to insert labels automatically as _(label) Now there is even a combobox in
the preferences>general, this could later be replaced if we have a dialog to
define keyboard shortcuts.

So hopefully it is possible to implement the keyboard shortcuts by the
combination of a file in _spe/shortcuts and the recipee of Josiah. This
would make all menu entries configurable. At first sight that all things
which should be keyboard configurable, should also be in the menu. So if is
not yet in the menu, it will be added to the menu. People are also asking
for code folding keyboards etc...

One last remarks, this conversation should be held on spe-dev mailing list.
So please subscribe to this list and answer there. I cc'd this mail already
to spe-dev. It's always good to get feedback.

Thanks for your support, as these shortcuts are a much requested feature...

Hi Richard,

First I had Ctrl+D or Cmd+D for Mac. Appearantly this was conflicting with
the EOF character on Linux. Therefore I changed it into Ctrl+Alt+D, not
knowing about Mac...

I don't like that people have to change the system preferences of course,
but I also prefer to have the same shortcut for all platforms. So how about
Ctrl+Shift+D?

Hi Vladlen,
I'll try as fast as possible to commit again to SVN, so you have the most up
to date files. I'm trying to fix something, but maybe it's more important to
commit already rather then waiting that everything is fixed.

My approach would be that to add a method to PythonBaseSTC in _sm/wxp/stc.py
which can load the external configuration from a file. As such I think these
files will be affected:
- sm\wxp\stc.py
- Child.py (more specific Panel.__source__ at line 199)
- dialogs\preferencesDialog.py
- defaults.cfg

I prefer to load the style configurator as a seperate dialog box from the
preferences window. I'm afraid that putting it directly into the preferences
dialog might slow down even more this dialog.

OK. Thanks. 
I already have started to design the style configurator as a separate dialog.

Message-ID: <2078a7ad0512101932j71cec687u30b94a6bc4b2cad6@mail.gmail.com>

Hi All,

This took a while, but I had quite some problems for the Mac. Now
files are run in a different way, so that they no longer threaten SPE
with infinite loops or wx applications. I think this is an important
step.

Basically there are three ways to run files:
- normal: SPE starts an external process
- through the debugger: some very new, interesting possibilities (I
will use this probably most of the time when developping programs)
- executes code snippets directly in the shell, by selecting them and
Edit>Execute
This change is also visible in the toolbar and menus.

I rewrote the chapter about running files, with detailed instructions.
Please give also feedback on spelling errors or wrong use of language,
as I am not native. The more critics the better and of course test
SPE. I'm sure you'll find some bugs. I still have to fix the show/hide
shell for Mac.

Unfortunately WinPdb can not catch unhandled exceptions with Python
2.4.2, but Nir Aides, the author, is working on a fix.

Thanks for testing,
Stani

PS Please report bugs as soon as possible. I want to release this as
0.8.1.a asap, as SPE 0.8.0.c is buggy.

--
New text for the manual (without the screenshots):

SPE provides many ways to run files:

Run (F9)
Use this option if you just want to run the script without that you
want to explore values of variables and program flow. It provides a
dialog, in which you can give arguments for the script and check if
you want to exit from the terminal window after running the script.
For example if your script contains print statements, you probably
want not to exit the terminal. You can run as many scripts as you want
with this option.

Run without arguments (Shift-F9)
Same as above but no dialog box is shown. This is a shortcut for
running scripts immediately, which require no arguments. The terminal
will stay open.

Run without arguments & exit (Shift-F9)
Same as above, but exits the terminal window.

Run/Stop with WinPdb (Ctrl-F9) (Cmd-F9)

Running scripts in this way will be slightly slower, but will give
many advantages while developing scripts: you can stop the script or
attach the debugger at any moment and choose whether you want to
launch the debugger at unhandled exceptions or at termination of the
script. You can only run one script at a time in this way.

The first time you invoke this command, SPE will run the script
through the debugger, which will remain invisible. Once the script is
running, it is possible to stop the script by invoking this command
again or to attach the debugger to the script. The second time you
invoke this command you stop the script.

The dialog gives the possibility to provide arguments for the script
and two options. The first option is whether you want to launch the
debugger at unhandled exceptions. The script is then finished, but you
can still analyze where it crashed and explore the values of the
global and local variables. (At the moment WinPdb 1.0.6 doesn't
support this feature for Python 2.4.2) The second option is want to
launch the debugger after running the script.

Debug with WinPdb (Alt-F9)

This command behaves differently depending on the situation. If a
script is running by the above command "Run/Stop with WinPdb", then
the debugger will attach itself to the running script. Otherwise the
debugger will start a new session with the current script.

The dialog gives the following options:
- Interface: You can choose whether you want a graphical or a console
debugger. It is recommended
- Path: It is recommended to change your working path to that of the
script. Otherwise local modules can't be imported.
- Encryption: This option is only available if you have the Python
Cryptography Toolkit (pyCrypto) installed on your system. If it is
available, it is recommended to use it, especially for remote
debugging.
- Verbose: Check this if you want more feedback from the debugger.
You can find more information in the "Debugger" chapter.

Import (F10)
Imports the source file as a module in the shell. It is recommended to
save the module first, otherwise the old version will be imported.

Execute (Ctrl-Alt-V)
This command is not under the "Tool" menu, but under the "Edit" menu.
It executes the selected text as a code snippet in the shell. If no
text is selected, SPE will execute the whole file.

Warning: Both "Import" and "Execute" run the script inside SPE as it
is. So never run programs with infinite loops, threads, wxPython,
etc... with these commands.  Otherwise SPE will block and you might
risk to loose data, if you didn't save all your files.

Ok, one vote to hide shell by default. You can always show/hide it through
the menu, keyboard shortcut F12 or the toolbar. Please Mac users bring out
your vote. The majority will win!

 The "Show dialog to launch debugger after executing script" didn't
make no sense, as this feature was not yet really implemented. So it
is taken out and therefore the manual had to be updated. Mac users,
please vote if shell is shown or hidden at start up. I believe mac
users prefer hidden, but I might be wrong.

Stani

Updated manual:

SPE provides many ways to run files:

Run (F9)

Use this option if you just want to run the script without that you
want to explore values of variables and program flow. It provides a
dialog, in which you can give arguments for the script and check if
you want to exit from the terminal window after running the script.
For example if your script contains print statements, you probably
want not to exit the terminal. You can run as many scripts as you want
with this option.

Run without arguments (Shift-F9)
Same as above but no dialog box is shown. This is a shortcut for
running scripts immediately, which require no arguments. The terminal
will stay open.

Run without arguments & exit (Shift-F9)
Same as above, but exits the terminal window.

Run/Stop with WinPdb (Ctrl-F9) (Cmd-F9)
Running scripts in this way will be slightly slower, but will give
many advantages while developing scripts: you can stop the script or
attach the debugger at any moment and choose whether you want to
launch the debugger at unhandled exceptions or not. You can only run
one script at a time in this way.
The first time you invoke this command, SPE will run the script
through the debugger, which will remain invisible. Once the script is
running, it is possible to stop the script by invoking this command
again or to attach the debugger to the script. The second time you
invoke this command you stop the script.
The dialog gives the possibility to provide arguments for the script
and one option whether you want to launch the debugger at unhandled
exceptions or not. The script is then finished, but you can still
analyze where it crashed and explore the values of the global and
local variables. The console needs therefore to be in "analyze" mode,
which you can do by typing "analyze" in the winpdb console. (At the
moment WinPdb 1.0.6 doesn't support this feature for Python 2.4.2)

Debug with WinPdb (Alt-F9)
This command behaves differently depending on the situation. If a
script is running by the above command "Run/Stop with WinPdb", then
the debugger will attach itself to the running script.

Otherwise the debugger will start a new session with the current script:

The dialog gives the following options:

Interface: You can choose whether you want a graphical or a 	console
debugger. It is recommended

- Path: It is recommended to change your working path to that 	of the
script. Otherwise local modules can't be imported.
- Encryption: This option is only available if you have the 	Python
Cryptography Toolkit (pyCrypto) installed on your system. If 	it is
available, it is recommended to use it, especially for remote
	debugging.
- Verbose: Check this if you want more feedback from the 	debugger.

If you close the debugger your script will also close, unless you
detach it first.

You can find more information in the "Debugger" chapter.

save the module first, otherwise the old version will be imported.

The toolbar button 'Run/Stop with WinPdb' is a toggle button, but a dialog
is shown each time.  Is this supposed to toggle?

Yes and it does. Try to run a wxPython application. If you press the button
for the first time a dialog fires up how you want to run the script and the
button shows a toggled state. If then the wxPython application runs, you can
stop it by pressing the button again and 'untoggling' it.
So the buttons shows the state of the running script. If the button is
toggled in, the script is running and if it is untoggled the script finished
execution. I could have used two seperate buttons start and stop, which are
alternatively abled and disabled, but I prefer compact design.
So there is not always a dialog shown, only when there is no script running.
I would have prefered to change bitmaps of tool buttons, but this doesnt
seem to be possible. Does anybody know?

I just checked again and I'd like to revise the prementioned bug:

 

When I first updated to SVN 95, I tried the toggle button and got the
previous bug.  Once I successfully ran a script, the toggle worked fine with
the cancel button.  It is most likely because the config doesn't have the
correct option to begin with, but once a successful attempt is made, the
option is created, and the cancel button works correctly.

If I bring up a new SPE instance... then click the toggle button, I get a 
dialog and the button toggles.  Then when I cancel, the toggle button does 
not reset itself.  it stays on the 'ON' state.  This happens with each new 
instance of SPE I open.

I'm using WinXP, if that makes a difference.

So is this bug solved? I can not reproduce it. If you provide me steps how
to reproduce, I could fix it.

Hi Richard,
That's it. The setup.py file contains a list of all data files, including
images. What I do is include the local subversion path of SPE in my
PYTHONPATH system variable. In that way you could skip the unnecessary and
incorrect step of setup.py
Thanks,
Stani

Hi Thurston,
Thanks a lot for the good report, I fixed it! I will release tonight current
state as SPE 0.8.1.a, unless someone of you fires me quickly with bug
reports ;-) Are there no comments on the Run documentation?

Hi,
A birthday update...

new
- add single click toggle for explore (not for Mac)
- add single instance application as preference
- update version number to 0.8.1.c

bug fixes
- removed unnecessary print statement
- find in files clear behavior (Thurston Stone)

I've also been working on Andrea's NotebookCtrl, so that now it
supports tooltips also on the Mac. I have to update SPE to the latest
version.

There's a bug in selection.  If my cursor is somewhere and I shift-select 
somewhere else, the selection starts from line 0 col 0, instead of the 
current cursor position.

It didn't seem big enough for the bug tracker, so I just thought I'd let you 
know

Hi Fuzzy,
It is all fixed in subversion release 109.
Stani

fixes:
- run with sys.executable (movable python)
- info.PYTHON_EXEC to pythonw for Mac
- __name__ in shell is now "__main__" for executing scripts

Hi all,

This is a really cool feature, which shows you as you type where your
code is syntacilly not correct. If you dont like it, you can cancel it
by setting in the preferences "Editor>Check realtime" to none.

Check it out!

Now in subversion repository r114...

default until they work nicely

 Hi all,

 Andrea Gavana and me are working on implementing some advanced use of
the NotebookCtrl, like showing tooltips on the file tabs, which
basically show up the path and the docstring of the file. This will be
an option in the preferences. It still has to be optimised and might
be a bit annoying now. We hope to fix this very soon. BTW, I?m very
happy that Andrea now also works on SPE. He has a lot of experience
with creating widgets and gui interface.

 I reported you enough with the new features which have been
implemented in subversion, so now an overview of what people are
working on

 INTEGRATED DEBUGGER
 Thurston Stone is already working on the integrated debugger and
Andrea will now also help to speed up the proces. Nir Aides (author
WinPdb) promised he would assist with integrating with the debugger,
although he was a bit busy.

 CONFIGURABLE STYLE COLORS
 Vlad is working on this, reported that it has been done for 40%

 CONFIGURABLE KEYS
 Toni is working on it, but no recent news yet.

 NEW INTERFACE
 I started preparing the new interface, which is about mdi-sdi, hiding
toolbars, statusbar, etc.. This however will take time.

 The goal is to have as much as possible implemented before mid
january when SPE get reviewed for the next PyCon. So it would be nice
if more people would join

Hi,
I will release today (wednesday) the last SPE release of this year. So
if there are any urgent issues with SPE in subversion, please report
them, preferably with patch as I won't have much time to fix them.
