...all landed in subversion (rev255). wxGlade and XRCed are taken from
their repositories, so they might be bleeding edge. Thanks to Diaa Sami
some issues on Windows are fixed (eg running files with spaces). Check
out the new SPE in the usual way:

    svn checkout svn://svn.berlios.de/python/spe/trunk/_spe

Enjoy,
Stani

Subject: [spe-dev] about sending patches
Message-ID: <46DB0CF7.1060501@gmail.com>

Hi all,
Some of you have sent patches to berlios. Because svn changes more
quickly than I review the patches it is too cumbersome to work with
these. Instead I prefer if you send me the full files (of course always
against latest svn) on this mailing list or privately.
With meld I can apply the patches then in a more comfortable way.
Thanks for your understanding,
Stani

Subject: [spe-dev] tabs bug

Hi all

First, sorry if you get this twice (have not seen my other post on the 
list).

Is it just me or does the tabs closing button not work properly? I'm 
using the last svn version on winxp and python2.5 and wxpython2.8.4.2.

If I hit the black close button on the tab, the tab disappears but is 
not closed. Go to Window and check which windows are still open! The 
tabs close if you click on the (gray) close button at the top right, but 
this appears only if you have more than one tab open and you have 
switched at least once (why could this button not be always visible?)

File->Close removes the tabs and the button, but the file is still open 
and visible! At this point you have no chance to close it.

I have tried to find the bug, but since I'm not familiar with the code 
and dont know wxpython either, I had little success :-( . I think its in 
_spe\sm\wxp\NotebookCtrl.py , but I'm not sure. Would be nice if someone 
could fix it (it is a bit annoying). As said I would like to help, but 
cant find it.

Another thing: if I close all windows (checking in menu Window) and exit 
spe, why does it open the last file I have closed the next time I start 
it? Could it be related to the tab problem?


Thx for spe.
