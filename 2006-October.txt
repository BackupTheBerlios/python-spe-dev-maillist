Subject: [spe-dev] building spe.deb
Message-ID: <453E5CE1.2010504@personnelware.com>

good news - using the script below, I just built a .deb using the current ver of 
spe and Ubuntu edgy (didn't try dapper, but it should be fine.)  It builds, 
installs and runs.

I caught 2 warnings:

dh_python: This program is deprecated, you should use dh_pysupport or 
dh_pycentral instead.

dh_builddeb
dpkg-deb: building package `spe' in `../spe_0.8.3-svn-158_all.deb'.
tar: -: file name read contains nul character

Plus if you run spe from a shell, you get a spew of messages:

(python:17433): Gdk-CRITICAL **: gdk_draw_drawable: assertion `src != NULL' failed

(python:17433): Gtk-CRITICAL **: gtk_container_remove: assertion `GTK_IS_TOOLBAR 
(container) || widget->parent == GTK_WIDGET (container)' failed

Exception exceptions.TypeError: "'NoneType' object is not callable" in 
<wx.lib.pubsub._NodeCallback instance at 0xb4e147ac> ignored

 > Thanks to Marco Ferreira there will be very soon a debian package to install SPE

Marco - you are on this list, right?  (if not, can someone forward this to him? 
  I don't have his e-mail.

Steve and Matthias, guessing you are on the list but did have yours, so you get 
extra :)

current ver is at https://help.ubuntu.com/community/UpdatingADeb

This will build spe.deb on a fresh Ubuntu install.

# mkspedeb.sh
# updates the spe.deb
# based on https://help.ubuntu.com/community/UpdatingADeb

set -xe

# needed to get source, compile and build debs
sudo apt-get --assume-yes install build-essential fakeroot subversion

# get the spe deps and source from apt repository
# (and debian/ dir needed to build the .deb)
sudo apt-get --assume-yes build-dep spe

mkdir spe && cd spe
apt-get source spe

# cd into the apt-got dir.
# this will need to be changed as the version changes.
# I could use find -t d to find a dir and cd into it, but this seemed safer.
cd spe-0.8.2a+repack

# hide the apt-got source
mv _spe _spe.apt-got

# get working copy
svn checkout svn://svn.berlios.de/python/spe/trunk/_spe

# bump the version number
# if this is not done, the new deb will be the same version as the current, so 
won't install.
# a few lines need to be prepended to debian/changelog,
# so put the lines plus existing changelog in changelog.tmp, replace changelog.

cat - debian/changelog >/tmp/changelog.tmp <<EOF
spe (0.8.3-svn-$(svnversion _spe)) unstable; urgency=low

   * Just based off the Ubuntu packaging -using $0

  -- Carl Karsten <carl at pw.com>  $(date --rfc-2822)

EOF
mv -f /tmp/changelog.tmp debian/changelog

# build the .deb
dpkg-buildpackage -rfakeroot -uc -b

# install the deb.
# using this command, on your own :)
echo sudo gdebi spe_0.8.3-svn-158_all.deb

Hi Carl,
Can you send me your latest spe.deb build and the build script as a
zipped attachment?

Here is the scrip I used to make a .deb.   it is just to test  if a .deb 
will build - I am not sure if it does it right, so I wouldn't sugest 
distributing the .deb -

we need to figure out who knows how to do it right

Subject: [spe-dev] Want to give SPE presentation to Python group from
	*anywhere* ?! :)
Message-ID: <20061031203528.GA23007@seberino.org>

Anyone want to give a SPE introductory talk to a Python Users' Group
from *anywhere* ?? :)

I am Chris Seberino, the founder of the SnakeCharmers
(http://snakecharmers.org) Python Users' Group.

We are very interested in SPE and would very much appreciate a talk
on SPE.  The plan is I would call you anywhere in the world
and you present your talk via speakerphone.  We could even set up
a PC so you could control your slides remotely!

If you want to promote your book or your consulting
services during your presentation that is 100% OK by us too.

We meet every 3rd Thursday of the month in San Diego, CA
and our talks are at 7pm PST (GMT -700).  The next possible date
therefore would be December 21, 2006 which is still open.

Please email me if you are interested.

Cheers,

Chris
