<PRE>This bug is gaving me headaches:
<A HREF="http://developer.berlios.de/bugs/?func=detailbug&amp;bug_id=4856&amp;group_id=4161">http://developer.berlios.de/bugs/?func=detailbug&amp;bug_id=4856&amp;group_id=4161</A>

This bug does *not* happen on Windows.


Thanks to Bill Scherer, a SPE Linux user, we could come quite clause
to where it happens:
 	
&quot;OK. After several rides through with the debugger, I've found that it
segfaults on line 442 of
/usr/lib/python2.4/site-packages/wx-2.6-gtk2-ansi/wx/lib/evtmgr.py,
which looks like this:


438    def handleEvent(self, event):
439        &quot;&quot;&quot;
440        In response to a wxWindows event, send a PS message
441        &quot;&quot;&quot;
442        self.publisher.sendMessage(topic=self.topic, data=event)


What I did was to start winpdb, and launch spe. I pressed F5 to let it
complete startup by itself. I had previously lauched spe to open
evtmgr.py, and had it set to remember files. In winpdb, I chose
File...Open Source, and entered evtmgr.py. I put a break point on line
438. speedometer.py was also remembered, and was in the topmost tab. I
clicked into the middle of the speedometer class name, and then when
back to winpdb and F6'd until all events were processed. I then
brought the focus back to spe and, noting that the insertion cursor
was in the middle of the class name, I hit the spacebar. Focusing back
to winpdb, I F6'd until segfault. The call path progressed through the
handleEvent code in evtmgr.py several times. The bottommost call in
your code was from the onUpdateUI method of the PythonBaseSTC class,
starting on or about line 283. Code from several other files in
/usr/lib/python2.4/site-packages/wx-2.6-gtk2-ansi/wx/lib was also run.
On about the fifth or sixth time through line 442, it segfaults. This
is repeatable.

Let me know what steps I can take from here to isolate the fault.&quot;

I wrote my own version of TreeCtrl and ListCtrl in sm.wxp.realtime and
I am quite sure they are the root of the problem. These classes are
developped to be able to easily replace only small items of the
control, without the need of emptying them first, which is to slow and
cpu consuming. Also it remembers what's open folded and what not. So
maybe we need to develop some test framework for them.

Maybe replacing the custom Tree control with the original wx.TreeCtrl
could prove its guilt, if this bug is not occuring anymore. Same for
the list control.
