<PRE>Hey Stani,

 

I agree about the default workspace. I'm working on making that happen.
I've named it default.sws.  Each piece will always be save in default.sws,
but only optionally saved in the other workspace files.  (oh, and I can
rename them from workspaces to sessions if you want. it makes no difference
to me).

 

I set up the workspace to save only if self.remember is true, because I know
a lot of times I'll use a workspace and add files that I don't want to be a
part of it. then next time I open it, it's got extra files.  I figured this
way, it would be more of a 'preference.'

 

&quot;self.remember should only influence if files are loaded at SPE startup or
not. All the other information like recent, notes, folders should always be
saved and reopened independent from self.remember&quot;

 

Perhaps this can be a preference. like a list box to define what is global
and what is workspace specific.  Personally, my recents get too cluttered
and I would like it to be workspace specific.  Each project that I have has
its own unique set of recent files I like to look at.  The same goes for the
Notes and Folders.  If it was a preference than that could work for both
methods.

 

I should have working fixes for the workspace soon.

 

To comment on some of your other comments:

1.	I was thinking of preferences very similar to firefox.  Where any
user with a plugin can add a preferences too.  Personally, I was going to
make a preference dialog that hid some tabs.  I'm still not sure what the
session tab is for and I rarely use some others.  If I need them, I would
like to turn them on in the preferences tab.  So that's where I was going
with that idea
2.	The current SPE doesn't have tabs spaces as a child variable, but as
a parent variable.  So basically, I have the editor open and the files I use
are set to 3 spaces.  SPE files are set to 4, so working with SPE files, I
always have to add that extra space when I have a new indentation (which is
real annoying).   I'll fix it again and send you the fix.

 

I'm not going to have time to work with Nir Aides until next week some time
(since Thanksgiving and all). After that, I'm very excited to get a working
embedded debugger going.

 

Thanks!

Thurston

Subject: Some remarks on workspaces to be fixed.

 

Hi Thurston,

Without defining a workspace SPE should continue to work like before.
Therefore I have the following remarks which should be fixed:

- If the user uses SPE without defining a workspace, there should be a
default one. This default working space should be saved in the user
directory just like remember.txt, etc.. I would call it 'defaults.cfg'

- Right now the workspace is only saved when self.remember is True It should
always be saved. Right now it is disturbing to loose all your recent files
(as I did), etc... when remember is not clicked. self.remember should only
influence if files are loaded at SPE startup or not. All the other
information like recent, notes, folders should always be saved and reopened
independent from self.remember

The point is that users shouldn't be forced to use workspaces. There should
be a default one, which garantuees that SPE works as it did before.

Could you please fix these issues?

Stani
