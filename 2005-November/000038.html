<PRE>Hi all,

This emails is about the latest svn revision, so please check it out.
These are the changes...

1 REALTIME.PY
I spent quite some time on completely rewriting
_spe/sm/wxp/realtime.py It should be done now, or I hope that some
minor bugs will easily be solved. To be short, this module is
responsible for the smart  updating on the sidebar (explore, index &amp;
todo), which permits but not only 'realtime updating as you type'. As
this file is at the core of SPE and was quickly implemented before, it
was responsable for a big amount of segfaults. If this issue is now
solved, it is a major step forward for SPE's stability, not only on
Mac, but also on other platforms. At the moment I don't see much
difference anyway between developping for the Mac or developping a
stable version for all platforms. It is very important that this is
100% bullet proof.
I had to wrote two test scripts in order to tackle the issue. They are
in _spe/tests Each file tests one class of realtime.py: TreeCtrl (for
explore) and ListCtrl (for index &amp; todo). Try to find bugs and please
try to reproduce them through the test files as well.
If realtime.py is completely fixed, it's time to take step 2: fix the
_spe/sm/wxp/smdi.py Than SPE is probably almost as near to the Mac as
it is to other platforms.

2. GENERICDIRCTRL DISABLED ON MAC
Unfortunately this standard wxPython control doesn't work (stable) on
Mac. I see no other option as disabling it for the Mac. Stefan
hopefully fixed this for wxMac. Can someone build wxPython based on
that to see if it is solved? I lack the knowledge and time to do this,
just for the record.

3. BACKUP
Backup files are from now on optional through the preferences.

Please try to focus for bug testing on point 1. I'd like to put this
out as a release as soon as possible as a lot of users are waiting for
this. However I'll try to implement quick feedback.

Thanks in advance,

Stani
