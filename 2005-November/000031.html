<PRE>Hi,
SVN is down. This file _spe/sm/wxp/realtime.py fixes a bug with the
explorer tree. More bugs with the explore tree are welcome, as this is
at the core of SPE, as such it has to be fast &amp; bullet proof. I need
still to rewrite it for the listctrl. I just provide it for those who
like to work with the latest files. This week I won't have too much
time. My mini roadmap is now:
- fix realtime.py
- disable genericdirctrl in child.py for mac
- fix smdi.py
- test these core files on the mac
- first alpha release 0.8.0.a

If they are not well written, SPE can never be stable on any platform.
I'll take care of them and if I need help with it, I will do. But for
now it is ok and no patches for these files are necessary.
and at the same time apply all patches which are brought you.

This week I will be a bit less responsive till next Tuesday, but I'll
try to work on SPE on lost moments.

Glenn, don't worry all your patches will make their way to SVN. Maybe
it's time for a more sofisticated remember state: which stores all
possible properties of a SPE child window, like its size, position,
... If you want to make an independent  custom wxNotebook class to
make moving tabs possible, I will only support it and integrate it in
SPE. Also I prefer patches as whole files. I use winmerge which is
very easy to work with whole files and my files might have changed in
the meantime. You could send them also privately if it would too much
spam this list.

Stani
