<PRE>Hi Glenn,
&gt;<i> Why is it that the active tab is moved to the last tab when saving the
</I>&gt;<i> remembered files? (see lines 644 and 645 of Parent.py)  Since it
</I>&gt;<i> actually took work to do this (as opposed to forgetting not to do it),
</I>&gt;<i> I can only assume this is a feature.  However, I find this feature to
</I>&gt;<i> be a little annoying.  If there's a reason for this, I'd be interested
</I>&gt;<i> in hearing it. (for now I'm satisfied with commenting those lines)
</I>This was just a lazy trick to make sure that that the last active tab
becomes again the active tab, when SPE is restarted. As I never gave
importance to tab order, I didn't think further about it. But now I do
and probably it would be better if SPE preserves the tab order and
switches to the last active one. This shouldn't be difficult to
implement by changing the format for remember.txt Now it is a
str(list) of (filename,linenr, column). You could make a dictionary
{'active':2,'files':[(x,x,x)]}

&gt;<i>  Also, I would like to suggest a feature to anyone so inclined (which
</I>&gt;<i> may be me).  It would be nice to be able to position the tabs.  I'm
</I>&gt;<i> thinking arrows to the right and left of all the tabs, which move the
</I>&gt;<i> active tab left or right when clicked.
</I>The best would be to create a custom wx.NotebookCtrl independent from
SPE. Instead of arrows, I would prefer a drag and drop mechanism, in
which you give dragging feedback by altering colours.Adding arrows in
every tab is an overkill. It should be central or even better with a
context menu with option as move left,right, first,last &amp; close.In
fact in SPE you'll find already the base code for this. Right now
middle clicking or right clicking closes a tab.You could replace
easily right clicking with a context menu.

&gt;<i>  I've attached a patch to fix some problems with file reloading (when
</I>&gt;<i> the file has changed on disk from a source outside the SPE editor).
</I>&gt;<i> self.fileTime should be updated in Panel.revert() and set in
</I>&gt;<i> Panel.__init__() if a fileName is given and not 'unnamed'.
</I>Great, I'll look at it. Some users reported this issue. It is nice
that you fixed it.

Stani
