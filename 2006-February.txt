Hi all,

Dimitri Pater (http://www.serpia.org) brought this under my attention:

This is a wonderful contribution!

A big thanks to Ian O, who made it, and to showmedo.com for hosting it!

Subject: [spe-dev] SPE & Python 2.2
Message-ID: <43E31441.4050401@voidspace.org.uk>

Hello all,

I'm about to release Movable Python for Python 2.3 & 2.4. There is a 
minor issue with the 2.2 version that needs to be fixed before I can 
release.

The latest version of wxPython that comes compiled for Python 2.2, is 
2.5.3.1.

The latest version of SPE I can find that works with this is 0.7.2b. It 
might be worth documenting this, and making it available via Berlios. 
That way anyone stuck with Python 2.2 can still use SPE.

All the best,

Fuzzyman

Subject: [spe-dev] Autocompletion on objects
Message-ID: <b4545ff10602110919r21a05c17y@mail.gmail.com>

Hi Stani et all,
First of all thanks for this wonderful piece of software!
Reading the following discussion appear that you're not
going to add such feature anytime soon ;)

>> import os
>> s = os
>> s.
>>
>> At the "." one would expect the autocomplete list to pick up the list
>> from "os" which would happen if "s" was interpreted correctly as an
>> instance of 'os',
>
>This is not possible. SPE is not allowed to execute arbitrary code for

>eraseMyHardDisk(), which would be a pitty if executed by default.

I should say that for example just clicking on PyDoc tab the code
is executed, see shell output ! So, also for PyDoc case
an eraseMyHardDisk() paranoia could be appropriate ;)

I know that boa-constructor have a parser to avoid code execution, but
of course this could be less precise compared to other method.

I don't know Spe internals right now and I don't even imagine how you
mind that codecompletion improvement but I can say:

1 - Make a yesno dialog before executing the PyDoc
    a - Warn about security reason
    b - Warn about that could be a time consuming process
    c - make such warning optional

2 - If you've already an idea on how to make codecompletion works also
     on user defined object please do it and make it optional ( disabled
     for default installation )

That's all for now have a good weekend,
luca

Subject: [spe-dev] Editor font won't change!
Message-ID: <20060224165932.32659.qmail@web31102.mail.mud.yahoo.com>

In the editor preferences, under "configure styles", I
can't get my settings for %(mono)s and %(size)d to
stay.  No matter what I enter, when I hit OK, then
save, the editor font returns to courier new, 10pt.  

This is a small bug, but it's pretty agravating.  My
monitor has very high resolution, and 10pt font is
nearly unusable.  (Not to whine too much, but this
whole preference panel is pretty complicated.  I'd
really like to see a wx.fontDialog and/or have ctrl+ /
ctrl- do zooming like many other apps)
