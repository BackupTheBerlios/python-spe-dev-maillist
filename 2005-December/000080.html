<PRE>Hi All,

This took a while, but I had quite some problems for the Mac. Now
files are run in a different way, so that they no longer threaten SPE
with infinite loops or wx applications. I think this is an important
step.

Basically there are three ways to run files:
- normal: SPE starts an external process
- through the debugger: some very new, interesting possibilities (I
will use this probably most of the time when developping programs)
- executes code snippets directly in the shell, by selecting them and
Edit&gt;Execute
This change is also visible in the toolbar and menus.

I rewrote the chapter about running files, with detailed instructions.
Please give also feedback on spelling errors or wrong use of language,
as I am not native. The more critics the better and of course test
SPE. I'm sure you'll find some bugs. I still have to fix the show/hide
shell for Mac.

Unfortunately WinPdb can not catch unhandled exceptions with Python
2.4.2, but Nir Aides, the author, is working on a fix.

Thanks for testing,
Stani

PS Please report bugs as soon as possible. I want to release this as
0.8.1.a asap, as SPE 0.8.0.c is buggy.

New text for the manual (without the screenshots):

SPE provides many ways to run files:

Run (F9)
Use this option if you just want to run the script without that you
want to explore values of variables and program flow. It provides a
dialog, in which you can give arguments for the script and check if
you want to exit from the terminal window after running the script.
For example if your script contains print statements, you probably
want not to exit the terminal. You can run as many scripts as you want
with this option.

Run without arguments (Shift-F9)
Same as above but no dialog box is shown. This is a shortcut for
running scripts immediately, which require no arguments. The terminal
will stay open.

Run without arguments &amp; exit (Shift-F9)
Same as above, but exits the terminal window.

Run/Stop with WinPdb (Ctrl-F9) (Cmd-F9)

Running scripts in this way will be slightly slower, but will give
many advantages while developing scripts: you can stop the script or
attach the debugger at any moment and choose whether you want to
launch the debugger at unhandled exceptions or at termination of the
script. You can only run one script at a time in this way.

The first time you invoke this command, SPE will run the script
through the debugger, which will remain invisible. Once the script is
running, it is possible to stop the script by invoking this command
again or to attach the debugger to the script. The second time you
invoke this command you stop the script.

The dialog gives the possibility to provide arguments for the script
and two options. The first option is whether you want to launch the
debugger at unhandled exceptions. The script is then finished, but you
can still analyze where it crashed and explore the values of the
global and local variables. (At the moment WinPdb 1.0.6 doesn't
support this feature for Python 2.4.2) The second option is want to
launch the debugger after running the script.

Debug with WinPdb (Alt-F9)

This command behaves differently depending on the situation. If a
script is running by the above command &quot;Run/Stop with WinPdb&quot;, then
the debugger will attach itself to the running script. Otherwise the
debugger will start a new session with the current script.

The dialog gives the following options:
- Interface: You can choose whether you want a graphical or a console
debugger. It is recommended
- Path: It is recommended to change your working path to that of the
script. Otherwise local modules can't be imported.
- Encryption: This option is only available if you have the Python
Cryptography Toolkit (pyCrypto) installed on your system. If it is
available, it is recommended to use it, especially for remote
debugging.
- Verbose: Check this if you want more feedback from the debugger.
You can find more information in the &quot;Debugger&quot; chapter.

Import (F10)
Imports the source file as a module in the shell. It is recommended to
save the module first, otherwise the old version will be imported.

Execute (Ctrl-Alt-V)
This command is not under the &quot;Tool&quot; menu, but under the &quot;Edit&quot; menu.
It executes the selected text as a code snippet in the shell. If no
text is selected, SPE will execute the whole file.

Warning: Both &quot;Import&quot; and &quot;Execute&quot; run the script inside SPE as it
is. So never run programs with infinite loops, threads, wxPython,
etc... with these commands.  Otherwise SPE will block and you might
risk to loose data, if you didn't save all your files.
