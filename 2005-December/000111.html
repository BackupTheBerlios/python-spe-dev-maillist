Now in subversion repository r114...

new
 - select text and middle click somewhere else = paste

 fix
 - tooltips on filetabs are now optional in preferences, turned off by
default until they work nicely

 Hi all,

 Andrea Gavana and me are working on implementing some advanced use of
the NotebookCtrl, like showing tooltips on the file tabs, which
basically show up the path and the docstring of the file. This will be
an option in the preferences. It still has to be optimised and might
be a bit annoying now. We hope to fix this very soon. BTW, I&#180;m very
happy that Andrea now also works on SPE. He has a lot of experience
with creating widgets and gui interface.

 I reported you enough with the new features which have been
implemented in subversion, so now an overview of what people are
working on

 INTEGRATED DEBUGGER
 Thurston Stone is already working on the integrated debugger and
Andrea will now also help to speed up the proces. Nir Aides (author
WinPdb) promised he would assist with integrating with the debugger,
although he was a bit busy.

 CONFIGURABLE STYLE COLORS
 Vlad is working on this, reported that it has been done for 40%

 CONFIGURABLE KEYS
 Toni is working on it, but no recent news yet.

 NEW INTERFACE
 I started preparing the new interface, which is about mdi-sdi, hiding
toolbars, statusbar, etc.. This however will take time.

 The goal is to have as much as possible implemented before mid
january when SPE get reviewed for the next PyCon. So it would be nice
if more people would join
