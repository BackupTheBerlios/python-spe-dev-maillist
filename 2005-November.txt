Hi,
Welcome and nice that you all subscribed! Could everyone on this list
mail me privately which system you use (os, python, wxpython
version,...)?
Thanks,
Stani

BTW SPE 0.7.5.e is under way...

Hi,
I hope most of you have subversion to follow the latest developments
in SPE. The url is:

Hi,

Not that I plan to release the next days, but I added a new feature
that I needed to SPE. It's a pydoc documentation browser. It's next to
UML in the tab. Please try it out and see if there are any bugs. If
you press on:
- most links: open documentation about that module
- index: show an overview of all available modules on your system
- a filename: opens this file in SPE

One thing to be careful of is that pydoc needs to import the file to
generate the documentation. Therefore SPE warns you to save files, in
case you didn't.

The roadmap for SPE remains the same:
- port SPE to the mac (try to fix all the critcal bugs)
- reorganize SPE in core+plugins like FireFox

Concerning Mac:
- the GenericDirCtrl seems to cause problems. So if there is no other
solution I'll have to disable that feature for Mac only. This is
probably easy to do, but a pitty

This bug is gaving me headaches:
http://developer.berlios.de/bugs/?func=detailbug&bug_id=4856&group_id=4161

This bug does *not* happen on Windows.


Thanks to Bill Scherer, a SPE Linux user, we could come quite clause
to where it happens:
 	
"OK. After several rides through with the debugger, I've found that it
segfaults on line 442 of
/usr/lib/python2.4/site-packages/wx-2.6-gtk2-ansi/wx/lib/evtmgr.py,
which looks like this:


438    def handleEvent(self, event):
439        """
440        In response to a wxWindows event, send a PS message
441        """
442        self.publisher.sendMessage(topic=self.topic, data=event)


What I did was to start winpdb, and launch spe. I pressed F5 to let it
complete startup by itself. I had previously lauched spe to open
evtmgr.py, and had it set to remember files. In winpdb, I chose
File...Open Source, and entered evtmgr.py. I put a break point on line
438. speedometer.py was also remembered, and was in the topmost tab. I
clicked into the middle of the speedometer class name, and then when
back to winpdb and F6'd until all events were processed. I then
brought the focus back to spe and, noting that the insertion cursor
was in the middle of the class name, I hit the spacebar. Focusing back
to winpdb, I F6'd until segfault. The call path progressed through the
handleEvent code in evtmgr.py several times. The bottommost call in
your code was from the onUpdateUI method of the PythonBaseSTC class,
starting on or about line 283. Code from several other files in
/usr/lib/python2.4/site-packages/wx-2.6-gtk2-ansi/wx/lib was also run.
On about the fifth or sixth time through line 442, it segfaults. This
is repeatable.

Let me know what steps I can take from here to isolate the fault."

I wrote my own version of TreeCtrl and ListCtrl in sm.wxp.realtime and
I am quite sure they are the root of the problem. These classes are
developped to be able to easily replace only small items of the
control, without the need of emptying them first, which is to slow and
cpu consuming. Also it remembers what's open folded and what not. So
maybe we need to develop some test framework for them.

Maybe replacing the custom Tree control with the original wx.TreeCtrl
could prove its guilt, if this bug is not occuring anymore. Same for
the list control.

Hi,
This patch from Glenn Washburn is hopefully very good news. It seemed
he solved the terrible bug which causes segfaults on SPE. Please try
out the patch _spe/sm/wxp/realtime.py
I'm very curious if this works. Please test it asap and let me knows
on which platform it solved the bug.
Big thanks to Glenn!

Subject: hack around bug in wxPython in deleting TreeItemIds from TreeCtrl
To: spe.stani.be at gmail.com


Stan,

Thanks for spe, it seems to be one of the better python IDEs out
there.  I've run across a bug in wxPython under gtk which causes a
segfault (it should be a problem on other platforms).  After a fair
amount of debugging, I narrowed the problem to the line "self.wx.Delete
(item.wx)" in Tree.Clean() in _spe/sm/wxp/realtime.py. The problem is
that wxTreeCtrl::Delete(wxTreeItemId id) deletes recursively the
children of id, so any references to these children should not be
deleted again (or it would be deleted twice).  However, in Tree.Clean()
this is precisely what happens, since the tree items are not looped
over in any particular order.  I have created a simple patch for this
and attached it.  I have not reported this to wxPython, so you might
want to forward this to their mailing list.  Thanks again, and I'd love
to get a reply indicating your acceptance/rejection.

Glenn

It's not helping with 0.7.5.d on FC4.  :-(

I guess I should try it with .e...

Or better with subversion!

I looked deeper in the subject and I almost completely rewrote the
realtime.Tree control, which should now be much more stable than before and
even avoid flickering. Please use the latest subversion or overwrite these
two files _spe/Child.py and _spe/sm/wxp/realtime.py
Check only for this specific bug. I have to rewrite the realtime.List in a
similar way. So only try the class explorer, todo and index might now be
buggy. But if the class explorer works well, I can solve the rest.

If it doesn't work please send the debug.txt.

I haven't done much explicit testing of the new code in realtime.py.
But I did find a couple bugs during usage.  The fixes are in
spe.realtime.patch, and are self explanatory.  I've also included a
patch to Child.y, which provides the which tab update function was
called to trigger to the exception in updateSidebar.  Also, I haven't
changed, but thing should be changed, the error message.  Not all
exceptions are going to be Bug #4627.  I haven't looked into it, but I
think that error message could be more appropriately/accurately placed.

Message-ID: <20051104111757.6aac4643@laptop>

Bug 4627 occurs in updateTodo because the self.previousTodoHighlights
contains some stale items (that is items not actually in the ListCtrl
anymore).  When trying to retrieve these items a ValueError exception
is thrown from ListItem.wx, since the item has already be removed from
its parents children list. Since the item should already be Deleted it
can be ignored. I recommend also that ListItem.children be renamed to
ListItem.siblings, as then the name would actually have a correct
meaning. Note, this patch contains my previous patch spe.Child.py.

Hello,

This would be simpler to commit the bugfix in svn for the current trunk
so we can just do a "svn up" to get your fix

Hi,

Thanks Glenn, but right now I don't have time to dive into it. However
a fast reaction...

As I said before I DO expect bugs for updateTodo and updateIndex. I
will rewrite the whole code for todo and index (sm/wxp/realtime.List &
ListItem), but first I need to know if the updateExplore
(realtime.Tree) works ok. When I rewrite the code I'll look to Glens
patches, but I know already what has to be done.

So try out SPE without touching the sidebar (= switching to todo or
index), type eg class something and press backspace and see if SPE
crashes.

I think whe sm/wxp/realtime.py is fine, a major step has been set.

Stani

If I understand you correctly, all three styles of wxGenericDirCtrl  
crash with same C++ assertion exception.
The demo code from wxPython demo is:
[code]
txt1 = wx.StaticText(self, -1, "style=0")
dir1 = wx.GenericDirCtrl(self, -1, size=(200,225), style=0)

txt2 = wx.StaticText(self, -1, "wx.DIRCTRL_DIR_ONLY")
dir2 = wx.GenericDirCtrl(self, -1, size=(200,225),  
style=wx.DIRCTRL_DIR_ONLY)

txt3 = wx.StaticText(self, -1, "wx.DIRCTRL_SHOW_FILTERS")
dir3 = wx.GenericDirCtrl(self, -1, size=(200,225),  
style=wx.DIRCTRL_SHOW_FILTERS,
                         filter="All files (*.*)|*.*|Python files  
(*.py)|*.py")
[/code]
Each time I commented out any two of them to test, but the exception  
was always there while initializing wxGenericDirCtrl object.

I believe I would need authorization to do so.  I have a berlios
account, but I don't have svn access.  I'm not sure I'll be
contributing enough to warrant svn access either.  I'm just fixing bugs
that hinder my using spe.

wxMac is still mostly me... I have checked the wxGenericDirDialog which
also uses the wxGenericDirCtrl and it still works correctly, could you
please send me a trace log, this perhaps helps to find out, what goes
wrong and where ...

Thanks,

I like very much that people send patches and I would like to stimulate that
as much as possible. However I believe for now it is better if I apply them
in the SVN. I hope later I could give other people as well SVN rights, but
the patches now still need my revision.

I couldn't find a GenericDirDialog demo in the wxPython demo. There  
is only a DirDialog in "Common Dialogs" category, which uses OS'  
native dir dialog, while GenericDirCtrl looks like a custom-drawn  
widget instead of a native one.

I reported this as SPE bug#5508. The SPE debug.txt is posted there,  
if that is trace log you are talking about. If not, please tell me  
how to generate it.
I also reported this as wxWidgets bug#1348373 after feedback from  
Stani. I noticed that you have responded to it. Now I just need to  
figure out how to make a wxPython build to test it.
It will be better if you can point out some pointers on how to debug  
such problem, I'd happy to learn that.

Thanks.

Hi Cheng
 
the best thing for me always is a stack-trace together with the assert,
this helps me to figure out on the C++ what might be going on. So the
trace log as posted in the SPE bug report is the best help for me.
 
Thanks,
 
Stefan

Subject: [spe-dev] remembering files out of order, patch to fix file reloading
Message-ID: <20051107094901.4ffe8730@laptop>

Why is it that the active tab is moved to the last tab when saving the
remembered files? (see lines 644 and 645 of Parent.py)  Since it
actually took work to do this (as opposed to forgetting not to do it),
I can only assume this is a feature.  However, I find this feature to
be a little annoying.  If there's a reason for this, I'd be interested
in hearing it. (for now I'm satisfied with commenting those lines)

  Also, I would like to suggest a feature to anyone so inclined (which
may be me).  It would be nice to be able to position the tabs.  I'm
thinking arrows to the right and left of all the tabs, which move the
active tab left or right when clicked.

  I've attached a patch to fix some problems with file reloading (when
the file has changed on disk from a source outside the SPE editor).
self.fileTime should be updated in Panel.revert() and set in
Panel.__init__() if a fileName is given and not 'unnamed'.

This was just a lazy trick to make sure that that the last active tab
becomes again the active tab, when SPE is restarted. As I never gave
importance to tab order, I didn't think further about it. But now I do
and probably it would be better if SPE preserves the tab order and
switches to the last active one. This shouldn't be difficult to
implement by changing the format for remember.txt Now it is a
str(list) of (filename,linenr, column). You could make a dictionary
{'active':2,'files':[(x,x,x)]}

The best would be to create a custom wx.NotebookCtrl independent from
SPE. Instead of arrows, I would prefer a drag and drop mechanism, in
which you give dragging feedback by altering colours.Adding arrows in
every tab is an overkill. It should be central or even better with a
context menu with option as move left,right, first,last & close.In
fact in SPE you'll find already the base code for this. Right now
middle clicking or right clicking closes a tab.You could replace
easily right clicking with a context menu.

Great, I'll look at it. Some users reported this issue. It is nice
that you fixed it.

Message-ID: <2078a7ad0511071800m5616b94fn20c6189b39ed80aa@mail.gmail.com>

Hi,
SVN is down. This file _spe/sm/wxp/realtime.py fixes a bug with the
explorer tree. More bugs with the explore tree are welcome, as this is
at the core of SPE, as such it has to be fast & bullet proof. I need
still to rewrite it for the listctrl. I just provide it for those who
like to work with the latest files. This week I won't have too much
time. My mini roadmap is now:
- fix realtime.py
- disable genericdirctrl in child.py for mac
- fix smdi.py
- test these core files on the mac
- first alpha release 0.8.0.a

If they are not well written, SPE can never be stable on any platform.
I'll take care of them and if I need help with it, I will do. But for
now it is ok and no patches for these files are necessary.
and at the same time apply all patches which are brought you.

This week I will be a bit less responsive till next Tuesday, but I'll
try to work on SPE on lost moments.

Glenn, don't worry all your patches will make their way to SVN. Maybe
it's time for a more sofisticated remember state: which stores all
possible properties of a SPE child window, like its size, position,
... If you want to make an independent  custom wxNotebook class to
make moving tabs possible, I will only support it and integrate it in
SPE. Also I prefer patches as whole files. I use winmerge which is
very easy to work with whole files and my files might have changed in
the meantime. You could send them also privately if it would too much
spam this list.

Subject: [spe-dev] Bug in realtime.py
Message-ID: <20051109142011.7c892423@laptop>

There is a bug in realtime.py where a deleted wx.TreeItemId is being
reused, causing a crash.  This can be created by creating a function
(eg: 'def test(): pass').  Copy and paste the function in the same
source window, such that there are now two functions of the same name
and defined exactly the same.  Now modify the name of the copied
function.  This causes a crash under gtk, and I would suspect other
problems on other platforms.

I've spent some time debugging this, but haven't come up with a
satisfactory patch.  If one adds 'assert not to.deleted' at the
beginning of Tree.CopyItemTo, then instead of a crash the exception is
caught and the improper error message is displayed (which I've noted in
previous emails).  This indicated that a deleted item is being reused.
Since Tree.CopyItemTo is only called in Tree._Update, where an unused
item is reused, but there is no check to determine is the widget has
been deleted.  I've fixed this, however there are still problems with
the tree not removing the old item.

I believe that some where in the mix there is a problem being caused by
the fact that Tree.items is indexed by the TreeItem.id, which is not
unique in the above case, nor should it be assumed to be in general.  I
think this is a problem that will require a fair amount of
restructuring.

I hope these patches fix the problem. I don't have acces to SVN now,
so I send the files as an attachment:
_spe/Child.py
_spe/sm/wxp/realtime.py

I tested it positively quickly, but more testing may be necessary.
Still only test the Tree class through the class explorer.

Glenn, thanks again for the bug report. It's important to get fast
feedback on the code which is written now, as it is meant to make SPE
stable.

If these patches are stable I'll fix the ListCtrl for the index and todo.

The particular problem I addressed does not cause crashing any longer,
however it still causes problems.  If you repeat the process, then
double click on one of the tree items with the same parent as the
function you duplicated and then changed the name of, an exception is
thrown.  Somehow the data for the tree item is a string, whereas it
should be a num (representing the line number).  Below is a backtrace,
with the first two lines being my own output.  The first line is before
the function duplication takes place and activating a tree item, and the
second is after the duplication and activating a tree item.

Hi,
As some people ask for a more advanced notebookctrl, this could be a
good candidate. Only if it is stable, I'll use it for SPE. So please,
try it it out and do some tough testing. It supports drag&drop, close
button, ...

It doesn't work "out-of-the-box" on Mac OS X (10.4.3) w/ wxPython  
2.6.1.0.
The tabs are missing, as you can see from the attached screenshot.

Message-ID: <2078a7ad0511211233v17c98b4bldb25a95b26c1c9f4@mail.gmail.com>

Hi all,

This emails is about the latest svn revision, so please check it out.
These are the changes...

1 REALTIME.PY
I spent quite some time on completely rewriting
_spe/sm/wxp/realtime.py It should be done now, or I hope that some
minor bugs will easily be solved. To be short, this module is
responsible for the smart  updating on the sidebar (explore, index &
todo), which permits but not only 'realtime updating as you type'. As
this file is at the core of SPE and was quickly implemented before, it
was responsable for a big amount of segfaults. If this issue is now
solved, it is a major step forward for SPE's stability, not only on
Mac, but also on other platforms. At the moment I don't see much
difference anyway between developping for the Mac or developping a
stable version for all platforms. It is very important that this is
100% bullet proof.
I had to wrote two test scripts in order to tackle the issue. They are
in _spe/tests Each file tests one class of realtime.py: TreeCtrl (for
explore) and ListCtrl (for index & todo). Try to find bugs and please
try to reproduce them through the test files as well.
If realtime.py is completely fixed, it's time to take step 2: fix the
_spe/sm/wxp/smdi.py Than SPE is probably almost as near to the Mac as
it is to other platforms.

2. GENERICDIRCTRL DISABLED ON MAC
Unfortunately this standard wxPython control doesn't work (stable) on
Mac. I see no other option as disabling it for the Mac. Stefan
hopefully fixed this for wxMac. Can someone build wxPython based on
that to see if it is solved? I lack the knowledge and time to do this,
just for the record.

3. BACKUP
Backup files are from now on optional through the preferences.

Please try to focus for bug testing on point 1. I'd like to put this
out as a release as soon as possible as a lot of users are waiting for
this. However I'll try to implement quick feedback.

Thanks in advance,

Stani

I can do this, perhaps this week. This isn't the only part of  
wxPython for Mac that is broken!

Hi Rob,

Thanks! That would be great. Report as detailed as possible any bugs
you encounter with wxMac to Stefan, as he is the lead developper (not
for wxPython, that's Robin Dunn who is away till 15 december). I guess
he'll be happy to fix any issue if he can. He prefers if you can send
him a tracelog:

"the best thing for me always is a stack-trace together with the
assert, this helps me to figure out on the C++ what might be going on.
So the trace log as posted in the SPE bug report
(http://developer.berlios.de/bugs/?func=detailbug&bug_id=5508&group_id=4161)
is the best help for me."

Stefans email is (# is @):
csomor#advancedconcepts.ch

If the issues are related to SPE, you can post here, otherwise it's
probably better to contact Stefan immediately.

Thanks,
Stani

Good to hear that. :-) I was thinking to do that but was caught up by  
other things since then.
Looking forward to the fixes.
Thanks.

This is strange behaviour on Mac only:
http://developer.berlios.de/bugs/?func=detailbug&bug_id=4817&group_id=4161
Does anyone knows why?

The popup menu is invoked in _spe/sm/wxp/stc.py by:
def OnRightClick(self, event):
if self.menu:
self.PopupMenu(self.menu, event.GetPosition())
else:
event.Skip()

It doesn't happen on Windows.

I confirmed that the default font (at least for the text editor) is  
very small for me as well.
Worse yet, just find out that I can't open the Preferences dialog via  
menu "Python/Preferences...". The exception is:
------

------
Looks like another wxPython bug, so I cross-post it to dev list as well.
I will submit this as a bug shortly after.

Hey Stani,

 

I agree about the default workspace. I'm working on making that happen.
I've named it default.sws.  Each piece will always be save in default.sws,
but only optionally saved in the other workspace files.  (oh, and I can
rename them from workspaces to sessions if you want. it makes no difference
to me).

 

I set up the workspace to save only if self.remember is true, because I know
a lot of times I'll use a workspace and add files that I don't want to be a
part of it. then next time I open it, it's got extra files.  I figured this
way, it would be more of a 'preference.'

 

"self.remember should only influence if files are loaded at SPE startup or
not. All the other information like recent, notes, folders should always be
saved and reopened independent from self.remember"

 

Perhaps this can be a preference. like a list box to define what is global
and what is workspace specific.  Personally, my recents get too cluttered
and I would like it to be workspace specific.  Each project that I have has
its own unique set of recent files I like to look at.  The same goes for the
Notes and Folders.  If it was a preference than that could work for both
methods.

 

I should have working fixes for the workspace soon.

 

To comment on some of your other comments:

1.	I was thinking of preferences very similar to firefox.  Where any
user with a plugin can add a preferences too.  Personally, I was going to
make a preference dialog that hid some tabs.  I'm still not sure what the
session tab is for and I rarely use some others.  If I need them, I would
like to turn them on in the preferences tab.  So that's where I was going
with that idea
2.	The current SPE doesn't have tabs spaces as a child variable, but as
a parent variable.  So basically, I have the editor open and the files I use
are set to 3 spaces.  SPE files are set to 4, so working with SPE files, I
always have to add that extra space when I have a new indentation (which is
real annoying).   I'll fix it again and send you the fix.

 

I'm not going to have time to work with Nir Aides until next week some time
(since Thanksgiving and all). After that, I'm very excited to get a working
embedded debugger going.

 

Thanks!

Thurston

Subject: Some remarks on workspaces to be fixed.

 

Hi Thurston,

Without defining a workspace SPE should continue to work like before.
Therefore I have the following remarks which should be fixed:

- If the user uses SPE without defining a workspace, there should be a
default one. This default working space should be saved in the user
directory just like remember.txt, etc.. I would call it 'defaults.cfg'

- Right now the workspace is only saved when self.remember is True It should
always be saved. Right now it is disturbing to loose all your recent files
(as I did), etc... when remember is not clicked. self.remember should only
influence if files are loaded at SPE startup or not. All the other
information like recent, notes, folders should always be saved and reopened
independent from self.remember

The point is that users shouldn't be forced to use workspaces. There should
be a default one, which garantuees that SPE works as it did before.

Could you please fix these issues?

Message-ID: <2078a7ad0511230420r253f8d09wa88a2c4bb94461a6@mail.gmail.com>

Check out latest version, mainly this is new:

* mac fixes
Got rid of a lot of segfaults, please report remaining ones.Having a mac
myself, they are now much more easy to solve.

* workspaces
Probably in the future SPE will have a full featured project manager, but
for now Thurston proposed to introduce 'workspaces'. A workspace is a
collection of all open files, recent files, folders of the path browser and
notes. They can be opened and saved in SPE. This workspace could then also
store breakpoints, the main script and debug command line options.
Warning: This still needs some work! The best is now if you work with SPE to
immediately save your workspace as something and turn on remember files
(heart icon on toolbar) otherwise you loose your recent files etc... This
will be fixed soon.

* smart indent
SPE now dedents automatically after break, return, etc...

Special thanks to Thurston Stone for his contribution!

News: SPE on PyCon
It has been brought to my attention that SPE will be presented on PyCon as
one of the four most promising IDE's:
http://wiki.python.org/moin/PyCon2006/Talks#19
Anyone who thinks having advice how SPE could perform good in this review,
can come up with ideas. Especially people who want to add it to the code.
This is btw why I put smart indentation in SPE as it was very easy.

Hi Stani
 
on which event are you opening the context menu ? on a mouse up ? this
would be wrong, as on mac it must open on mouse down, therefore you
should only catch the context_menu event not the real mouse down/up,
this would then work on every platform.
 
Thanks,
 
Stefan

Hi Stefan,

   - I just tried it, but what is weird that the context menu appears
   very far from the mouse cursor. Both on Windows and Mac. Am I missing
   something?
   - Another issue is on Mac, if I right click for the context menu and I
   click out of the context menu to let it dissappears, the default context
   menu of stc appears (undo,redo,cut,copy,paste,delete.select all). You
   can't get rid of it except by selecting a command of it. Should I overwrite
   the mouse left down with an dummy function?

Thanks for your help,
Stani

Subject: [spe-dev] Context menu fixed, but still *very* serious bug in wxPython.
Message-ID: <2078a7ad0511241149l59692d68yc9188bb43b9e021f@mail.gmail.com>

Hi Stefan,
I could solve the issue. Unfortunately the context menu event doesn't work
properly as the event.GetPosition returns a wrong value. This does the job:

        if self.menu:
            self.UsePopUp(False)
            if wx.Platform=='__WXMAC__':
                self.Bind(wx.EVT_RIGHT_DOWN, self.OnRightClick)
            else:
                self.Bind(wx.EVT_RIGHT_UP, self.OnRightClick)

Just to let you know.

A bug which is really worrying me is that any program hangs if you select a
text in an stc control and left click inside this selected text. Then any
wxpython program hangs and the only solution is 'force quit'. Could you
please tell me what can be done about this. I think this is a really serious
issue.

Thanks,

Stani

Subject: [spe-dev] Mac questions (please help)
Message-ID: <2078a7ad0511250819x8c64212k1c57aab806f755@mail.gmail.com>

The following questions are specifically about Mac. Probably you might know,
which I as a Mac newbie don't. So here we go...

* Child.py: How do I close a terminal window with apple script?

 For the Tools menu 'Run in terminal and exit', I wrote the following code
which works fine but I would prefer if the window closes. Anybody know why?
os.system("""osascript -e 'tell application "Terminal"' -e 'activate' -e 'do
script with command "cd %(path)s;pythonw %(file)s;logout"' -e 'end
tell'"""%params)

So the apple script is:

tell application "Terminal"
 activate
 do script with command "cd %(path)s;pythonw %(file)s;logout"
 -> what should be put here to close the window?
end tell

* SPE.py: How to redirect the shell on Mac? (reported by Rich):

If I copy/paste the command line, I get an error using tcsh:

-----------
richb% pythonw SPE.py --debug > debug.txt 2>&1
tcsh: Ambiguous output redirect.
-----------

* I'm wondering if is possible make desktop/finder aliases like
.bash_profile aliases:

alias spe='pythonw
/Library/Frameworks/Python.framework/Versions/Current/lib/python2.4/site-packages/_spe/SPE.py'


Of course I could make a python script (as I did: SPE_DEBUG.py) and make an
alias to that, but I was just curious.

Thanks in advance,

Stani

Subject: [spe-dev] mac installation instructions (please review)
Message-ID: <2078a7ad0511250925v616a986arcbe42aecb8d0181c@mail.gmail.com>

These are the instructions I wrote for the manual. Please let me know your
remarks, both on content and english:
Introduction

Mac Os X provides itself wxPython. Unfortunately there is a big chance that
this version is outdated. Therefore following instructions 'Python' and
'wxPython' will explain you how to install wxPython yourself. You only have
to follow them in case the python and wxPython versions of your Os X are not
matching SPE's requirements, otherwise only follow the 'SPE' instruction.

At the moment of this writing the latest version of Os X is Tiger (10.4). It
ships with Python 2.3 and wxPython 2.5. For SPE you'll need wxPython 2.6 and
at least Python 2.3 In order not to interfere with the installed system,
this manual will explain you how to install Python2.4 with wxPython2.6 In
general it is always better to use a later version of Python as mostly it is
more stable and faster.
Python

Activestate provides nicely wrapped installers for Python for Mac Os X.
Download it and launch the installer. Choose the latest Python version for
Mac Os X from:

http://www.activestate.com/Products/Download/Download.plex?id=ActivePython

In order to let this python version precede, edit the following line your
'.bash_profile'. This file is located in your home directory. If it doesn't
exist, create an empty text file with this name in your home folder. Don't
skip this step or your installation will fail! Close afterwards all terminal
windows (to make sure that the PATH variable is exported).

export PATH = "/usr/local/bin:$PATH:/Developer/Tools:/Library/Frameworks/Python.framework/Versions/Current/bin/"

 WxPython

Download the latest binary built for the Python version you installed from:

http://www.wxpython.org/download.php#binaries

   -

   You can install packages for OsX 10.3 also on 10.4 The
wxPython.orgwebsites mentions: "
   *Eventhough the Panther packages below were built on an OSX
10.3system they will still work on Tiger provided you also have this
package
   installed.*" You can safely ignore this message.

Launch the installer.
SPE

At the moment SPE is not yet available as an application. Download the
source distribution tar.gz instead. Unpack it to a certain path and open a
new terminal in that path. In the terminal enter the following command:

python setup.py install

 This installs SPE in the site-packages directory of your default Python
installation. You can now create aliases for the terminal by adding these
lines in your '.bash_profile':

alias spe='pythonw
/Library/Frameworks/Python.framework/Versions/Current/lib/python2.4/site-packages/_spe/SPE.py'
alias winpdb='pythonw
/Library/Frameworks/Python.framework/Versions/2.4/lib/python2.4/site-packages/_spe/plugins/winpdb/winpdb.py
-t'
alias debug_spe='pythonw
/Library/Frameworks/Python.framework/Versions/2.4/lib/python2.4/site-packages/_spe/plugins/winpdb/winpdb.py
-t -c /Library/Frameworks/Python.framework/Versions/Current/lib/python2.4/site-packages/_spe/SPE.py
--debug'



 Starting SPE is now as easy as typing 'spe' in the terminal. You can also
type 'spe ?debug' to run SPE in debugging mode.
Uninstall

Remove the '_spe' folder from your python site-packages directory, eg:


 /Library/Frameworks/Python.framework/Versions/2.4/lib/python2.4/site-packages


 One needs also to remove
/Library/Frameworks/Python.framework/Versions/2.4/bin/spe manually.

As I want to speed up the development and not getting too much feedback on
the subversion, I tought it was time for a release ;-) Moreover this version
is anyway better than any previous one.

so here comes straight a bit info about from my testing tour:

Can you send me the error log. I agree with you, but I couldn't reproduce
the error on Windows XP SP2 or MacOS X 10.4. So then I know what to fix.

2.) Tools Menue

Fixed in subversion.

3.) Tooltips for the Buttons

I now fixed to replace Ctrl with Cmd (is this ok?), but with what should I
replace Alt?  In subversion, _spe/Menu.py:
def _(x):
    if '|' in x and info.DARWIN:
        return x.replace('Ctrl','Cmd')
    else:
        return x


4.) Tabs

My screen too ;-) Confirmed, will fix it.

- Notes Tab, or also in Sidebar

Confirmed, will try to fix it, but it is weird.

- Tooltips for the Tab-Buttons would be a nice to have


This is not possible afaik.

5.) Show/Hide Shell

Confirmed, will fix.

6.) Blender and Spe

Yes, Blender support is postponed, as Blender 2.40 is not stable itself
(especially concerning sys.path). You can put them in the bug tracker. Put
them in category 'Plugin'.

- Still blender python hangs when spe is quit.

That's ok. I'm happy with all feedback.

Subject: [spe-dev] NotebookCtrl Widget Problem On Mac FIXED!!
Message-ID: <2078a7ad0511301215j398c0bf6k8f7b78dfd997ff35@mail.gmail.com>

Hi Andrea,

Thanks to SPE Mac users who sponsered SPE with a Mini Mac, I was able to
debug your control with winpdb debugger. So now the light is green to get
your control into SPE.

After plunging in the code, I managed to get the control working. The
problem is that wxMac doesn't seem to support the wx.DefaultSize (-1,-1)
which is always transformed in (0,0). So setting the size to like
wx.Size(28,28)
solves the issue. I'll email you privately with the patch.

I'm not sure if it is 100% stable. I found some bugs, which I also will send
to you.

For those who like to see the screenshot:

Best regards,
Stani

Message-ID: <2078a7ad0511301247m72895868wdb4db2d317c32c@mail.gmail.com>

Hi Andrea,

FIX

So this how I would fix the control. I leave it up to your preference of
design how you want to implement it. In the beginning of the NotebookCtrl.py,
I would define a constant like this:

if wx.Platform == '__WXMAC__':
    DEFAULT_SIZE = wx.Size(28,28) #or any value you prefer
else:
    DEFAULT_SIZE = wx.DefaultSize

Then replace EVERYWHERE wx.DefaultSize by DEFAULT_SIZE, also in
NotebookCtrlDemo.py in fact if you replace line 942 with the following, the
demo works already:
        NC.NotebookCtrl.__init__(self, parent, id, pos=wx.DefaultPosition,
                                 size=wx.Size(28,28),
notebookctrlstyle=style)

I noticed in your code that you used once wx.Size(20,20) but that's not
enough as the size is passed through as an argument and wx.Size(20,20) is
then replaced by wx.DefaultSize

Unfortunately I can not use the control yet for SPE as closing a tab with a
close button causes a crash.

BUGS

1
A bug on Mac is that the PopupWindow is not implemented appearantly. Maybe
you could ask to Stefan Csomor if this is a wxMac problem or a wxPythonMac
problem. As it is unclear when it will be implemented the best way is
probably to catch the expression with a try except NotImplementedError
clausule:

Subject: [spe-dev] Close bug fixed!
Message-ID: <2078a7ad0511301316g6672ff22x617d24ab2f90faa9@mail.gmail.com>

Hi Andrea,

I found the code which crashes on Mac: dlg.SetFont(wx.Font(8, wx.NORMAL,
wx.NORMAL, wx.NORMAL, False, "Verdana"))

Luckily it's not part of the core NotebookCtrl.py, but only of the demo.
Maybe you can just leave this line out unless you really want to use Verdana
on Windows and Linux.

Curious to get the new NotebookCtrl!

Stani

    def OnPageClosing(self, event):

        msg = "Are You Sure You Want To Close This Page?"
        dlg = wx.MessageDialog(self, msg, "NotebookCtrl Question",
                               wx.YES_NO | wx.NO_DEFAULT | wx.CANCEL |
wx.ICON_QUESTION)

        #dlg.SetFont(wx.Font(8, wx.NORMAL, wx.NORMAL, wx.NORMAL, False,
"Verdana"))

        if dlg.ShowModal() in [wx.ID_NO, wx.ID_CANCEL]:
            self.log.write("OnPageClosing: Closing Event Blocked By User\n")
            dlg.Destroy()
            return

        dlg.Destroy()
        self.log.write("OnPageClosing: Deleted Page With Small Closing X\n")

        event.Skip()
