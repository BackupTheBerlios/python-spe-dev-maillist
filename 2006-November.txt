Subject: [spe-dev] option to update from SVN
Message-ID: <45501451.7010603@personnelware.com>

As a developer tool developer (VFP tools, which no one here will have much 
interest in)  I appreciate the value in having other developers using the latest 
version, even if it is not rock solid.  developers have a good idea what to 
expect, and what is expected of them with regards to reporting bugs, asking for 
features, complaining, etc.

Which is why I was trying to make it easy to use the SVN version of SPE, and yet 
not circumvent the package manager which in the past seems to lead to problems.

I am giving up on trying to have a cutting edge spe.deb.  I was told Stani 
shouldn't add the debian/ dir to his source repo, but that is about the only 
help I have gotten.  If anyone has anything to say, now would be a great time.

So now I have a new idea:  some sort of 'update from svn' that would update spe 
in place.  This may be A) a bad idea or B) more trouble than it is worth.

It also got me thinking:  Could SPE have some sort of source control 
integration?    I am forever forgetting to add new files, and not too good about 
commits either.  It would be really nice to have SPE do that for me, like when a 
file is run, or closed, or when SPE is closed.

Given that I have yet to do much phython, don't ask me to code these.  not this 
week anyway.
