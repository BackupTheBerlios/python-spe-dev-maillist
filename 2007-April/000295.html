<PRE>Excellent patch, falan!  I'd like to see this go in the next svn commit.
<A HREF="http://developer.berlios.de/patch/?func=detailpatch&amp;patch_id=1967&amp;group_id=4161">http://developer.berlios.de/patch/?func=detailpatch&amp;patch_id=1967&amp;group_id=4161</A>

Parens/brackets work exactly as expected, and the TAB jump is nice too...
(Note that it is off rev. 236, which TortoiseSVN handled transparently even
though I am updated to 237!  I love that program...)

A couple comments/suggestions for future work: Stacked parens work well, but
I think we need more thought on what to do with stacked quotes (perhaps
automatically escape them, except that would make it difficult to
triple-quote the beginning of a string).  Additionally, I expect backspace
to delete the matched brace, so if I hit '{', then backspace, I don't want
the orphan '}' still there.

Finally, a bit of commentary from code review:
Most of it looks very clean to me.  You have the undone work of turning
matching parens into an option (which should described with a &quot;# todo:&quot;).
Also, there is some repeated code that should be cleaned up: in OnChar() the
&quot;if aiPairBracket !='disable':&quot; block is repeated under both CallTipActive()
alternatives.  Since you are doing the same thing in either case, it should
be pulled out of the block altogether.

Most of what I wrote is critiquing what you did or should do next.  Of
course, if you think I am wrong, please tell me rather than silently curse
me.  Please recognize that I am taking the time to review this because it is
a useful patch, and I'd like to see you contribute more.  The project is
better off for your contribution.

Cheers,
Carver
